Kara Hilburger is a seasoned data privacy attorney who designs and operationalizes scalable, enterprise-wide data privacy and compliance programs for organizations seeking to align legal, technical, and business objectives. Known for her pragmatic, business-aligned approach, Kara advises cross-functional stakeholders—including legal, IT, compliance, and marketing teams—on building privacy infrastructures that are not only legally sound, but also sustainable, adaptable, and aligned with long-term strategic objectives.


Kara counsels clients on compliance with an array of U.S. federal and state privacy laws—CCPA/CPRA, VCDPA, CPA, FCRA, TCPA—as well as international frameworks, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF). She brings deep experience in conducting regulatory risk assessments, developing internal and consumer-facing policies, executing data mapping and governance initiatives, and advising on incident response preparedness and breach protocols. 


A key area of Kara’s practice involves advising clients on technology transactions, vendor risk management, and AI governance, including the review, negotiation, and strategic alignment of Data Processing Agreements (DPAs), cloud and SaaS contracts, and broader commercial technology agreements. Her ability to translate complex regulatory requirements into actionable business terms makes her a trusted partner in high-stakes vendor negotiations and compliance reviews. She partners with clients to develop responsible AI governance frameworks, implement model risk assessments, and embed transparency, accountability, and human oversight into AI-enabled business processes. 
She partners with ecommerce brands, leading global manufacturers, and professional sports organizations to advance enterprise-level privacy and security initiatives that balance innovation with regulatory integrity.

Kara is also recognized for her work in digital accessibility under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

In the area of marketing compliance, Kara advises on the development of privacy-forward, globally compliant marketing programs—helping clients navigate a patchwork of regulations including CAN-SPAM, cookie and tracking consent rules, and international marketing and privacy directives. She also counsels organizations on cookie governance and consent management frameworks designed to minimize legal and reputational risk, ensuring transparency and accountability across digital ecosystems. Kara works closely with marketing, product, and data teams to align business practices with consumer privacy expectations and legal obligations.

A strategic thinker and hands-on advisor, Kara frequently leads the development and rollout of organization-wide privacy training and awareness programs, driving a culture of collaboration, commitment and engagement across all levels of the enterprise.
